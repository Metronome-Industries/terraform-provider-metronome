## Schema

### Read-Only

- `data` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--data"></a>
### Nested Schema for `data`

Read-Only:

- `archived_at` (String)
- `current` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data--current))
- `custom_fields` (Map of String)
- `id` (String)
- `initial` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data--initial))
- `type` (String) Available values: "USAGE", "SUBSCRIPTION", "COMPOSITE", "FIXED", "PRO_SERVICE".
- `updates` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data--updates))

<a id="nestedatt--data--current"></a>
### Nested Schema for `data.current`

Read-Only:

- `billable_metric_id` (String)
- `composite_product_ids` (List of String)
- `composite_tags` (List of String)
- `created_at` (String)
- `created_by` (String)
- `exclude_free_usage` (Boolean)
- `is_refundable` (Boolean) This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.
- `name` (String)
- `netsuite_internal_item_id` (String) This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.
- `netsuite_overage_item_id` (String) This field's availability is dependent on your client's configuration.
- `presentation_group_key` (List of String) For USAGE products only. Groups usage line items on invoices. The superset of values in the pricing group key and presentation group key must be set as one compound group key on the billable metric.
- `pricing_group_key` (List of String) For USAGE products only. If set, pricing for this product will be determined for each pricing_group_key value, as opposed to the product as a whole. The superset of values in the pricing group key and presentation group key must be set as one compound group key on the billable metric.
- `quantity_conversion` (Attributes) Optional. Only valid for USAGE products. If provided, the quantity will be converted using the provided conversion factor and operation. For example, if the operation is "multiply" and the conversion factor is 100, then the quantity will be multiplied by 100. This can be used in cases where data is sent in one unit and priced in another.  For example, data could be sent in MB and priced in GB. In this case, the conversion factor would be 1024 and the operation would be "divide". (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data--current--quantity_conversion))
- `quantity_rounding` (Attributes) Optional. Only valid for USAGE products. If provided, the quantity will be rounded using the provided rounding method and decimal places. For example, if the method is "round up" and the decimal places is 0, then the quantity will be rounded up to the nearest integer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data--current--quantity_rounding))
- `starting_at` (String)
- `tags` (List of String)

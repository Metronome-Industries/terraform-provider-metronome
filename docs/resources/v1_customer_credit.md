## Schema

### Required

- `access_schedule` (Attributes) Schedule for distributing the credit to the customer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_schedule))

- `priority` (Number) If multiple credits or commits are applicable, the one with the lower priority will apply first.
- `product_id` (String)

### Optional

- `applicable_contract_ids` (List of String) Which contract the credit applies to. If not provided, the credit applies to all contracts.
- `applicable_product_ids` (List of String) Which products the credit applies to. If both applicable_product_ids and applicable_product_tags are not provided, the credit applies to all products.
- `applicable_product_tags` (List of String) Which tags the credit applies to. If both applicable_product_ids and applicable_product_tags are not provided, the credit applies to all products.
- `custom_fields` (Map of String)
- `description` (String) Used only in UI/API. It is not exposed to end customers.
- `name` (String) displayed on invoices
